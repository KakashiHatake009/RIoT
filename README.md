ðŸŒ± # Smart Irrigation System

The Smart Irrigation System is an intelligent, IoT-based solution designed to optimize water usage in agriculture and gardening by automating irrigation based on real-time environmental data. It ensures plant growth under favorable conditions while reducing human intervention, operational costs, and water waste.

## Objectives

- Preserve and optimize water usage.
- Ensure sufficient water supply for healthy plant growth.
- Enable minimal supervision and low maintenance.
- Integrate resilience mechanisms to handle hardware faults and data inconsistencies.

## How It Works

The system utilizes environmental data collected from sensors implanted in pots to monitor:

- Temperature
- Soil Moisture
- Rain Forecast / Rain Detection

This data is:

- Published over Wi-Fi using the MQTT protocol.
- Stored securely in the cloud for monitoring and analysis.
- Processed to make real-time irrigation decisions.

## Intelligent Decision-Making

By evaluating temperature, soil moisture, and weather forecasts, the system:

- Decides when to irrigate plants.
- Avoids unnecessary watering (e.g., when rain is predicted).
- Minimizes manual input with automated responses.

This enhances plant growth while conserving water and reducing operational costs.

## Resilience and Fault Tolerance

Since hardware components (like sensors and Wi-Fi modules) are prone to:

- Failures
- Faulty readings
- Connectivity issues

The system incorporates resilient strategies such as:

- Fallback logic for missing or corrupted sensor data.
- Redundant checks to validate sensor readings.
- Cloud synchronization to recover from device failures.

This ensures reliable operation and consistent decision-making even under unexpected conditions.

## Technologies Used

- MQTT Protocol for lightweight message transfer.
- Cloud Storage for data logging and analytics.
- IoT Sensors (temperature, moisture, rain).
- Wi-Fi Communication module (e.g., ESP8266/ESP32).
- Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers for local control logic.

## Future Enhancements

- Add mobile dashboard or web app for real-time visualization.
- Implement machine learning to predict irrigation needs.
- Integrate solar power for sustainable energy usage.
